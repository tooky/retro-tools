## What happened

- I got the basic functionality in place.
- Used a make/diff based approval worflow, stolen shamelessly from adr-tools.

## Insights

- Its really quick to add new basic functionality.

## Actions

- Share the tool with the team to see if it makes sense for them yet.
- Think about a release process - maybe a brew cask?
